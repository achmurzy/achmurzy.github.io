This blog is currently meant to serve as a reflection on the last four years of my life. In that time I started keeping a relatively consistent journal, and the result has been the first concrete record of my mental state over an extended period of time. I still enjoy the versatility and spontaneity of my spiral-ring, but I’ve gotten to the point where I want to be able to share my thoughts and ideas and secure them for posterity. The insight I’ve gained from looking back on old journals (which are beginning to fall apart from wear) makes this second point important to me; I will cherish these words in five years, and the ones I write in the meantime ten years thereafter, and so on. When I find myself asking who I am and how I got here, looking back like this has given me the most satisfying answers–less harrowing than traversing the selective memory, at least.

Throughout, these journals have served as psychotherapists, planners, workbooks and blueprints. I speak in fragments, stylize, and fly into poetics. I will spare us all the more desperate moments recorded there–these are usually frivolous and anxious feelings which writing has proven capable of massaging from of my mind. They are gone with the words on the page. Rather, the purpose of this exercise is to trace the line of thinking that’s informed my decision making, interests and philosophy over the last four years. The structure of the blog amounts to distillation of journal entries I deem important from this period, and any musings I might have about passages that ended up being insightful and productive, or else misguided or downright untrue. Many of the entries would be largely unintelligible without exposure to my own internal monologue, and with luck I’ll be able to uncover some of the assumptions that allow all of us to field the arguments, diatribes and reflections raging in our minds from day to day.
