Most of the time when I talk about gameplay I have something rather specific in mind: three-dimensional action games where a particular character is guided by the player around a virtual space. Super Mario 64 is probably the archetypal  example of this, and one of the most perfectly executed. In formulating all the gobbledygook prior to this I tried to make a definition of gameplay that admitted all other kinds of games. It soon became clear to me that I didn’t have a clear idea what a game was, and what criteria qualified something to be “gamelike”.

It began with considering how narratives unfold in games of the type mentioned before–3D action games like Shadow of the Colossus and Super Mario 64. Much of the game proper is a series of obstacles that call for the player to solve problems through gameplay. I began to question the purpose of these obstacles, like jumping puzzles or defeating enemies. Are these necessary to tell a story using interaction? Exactly what kinds of interaction can be surrogates for storytelling? In general, much of the problem solving in games do not serve a real narrative purpose–they are bumpers of “game time” between cutscenes with lots of exposition, jam-packed with plot content. At some point the obstacles end, the game is complete, and the story is over. Folks from my parent’s generation call this “winning” the game–and those folks never really understood what was so exciting about it. Why do games end? Must they? Why are we still “winning” games like we win Connect 4?

These kinds of deeply semantic, basically uninteresting questions of definition kept me from making actual interactive software and instead drove me into the deep, dark world of “game studies”. This is more or less a runaway branch of anthropology that became much larger when video games and the internet became significant parts of cultural studies and new media theory in the late ’80s and throughout the ’90s. I did a lot of reading, and had fun doing it as a college freshman intent on exploring the world (mostly the library, in fact). The extensive notes I took may have actually had a positive effect on my writing skills, and was an inadvertent first experience in plumbing primary literature, which has turned out to be perhaps the most important research skill I’ve acquired.

Here I’ll try to pick out the most significant works that continue to have an effect on my thinking.

The uncontested doyen of game studies is a little-known Dutchman named Johan Huizinga. He wrote a little book called Homo ludens, a play on our species name meaning, roughly, “playing man”. He was interested in the history of playing and playful culture in human (Western) civilization. His definition of play bears repeating:

    Play is a voluntary activity or occupation executed within certain fixed limits of time and place, according to rules freely accepted but absolutely binding, having its aim in itself and accompanied by a feeling of tension, joy, and the consciousness that it is ‘different’ from ordinary life

This fixed, demarcated time and place in which play occurs is referred to as the “magic circle” nowadays. Earlier I mentioned my belief that game designers have little hope of “forcing” players to feel anything in particular from any kind of interactive design. That belief stems from this definition of play. A player can only ever willingly submit to the confines of a game’s rules and assumptions. To put things in dramatic terms again, I’ve always viewed this as the gaming equivalent of suspension of disbelief, which any audience member must undergo to authentically enter a theater and have a dramatic experience. Another term for this process is the “ludic attitude”–simply, the willingness to submit to the internal logic of a game. The most important thing I took away from this conception of things is an appreciation that games must have a discernible internal logic which players can recognize and submit to before play occurs. 

The second significant figure to emerge from this world was a Frenchman named Roger Callois. He wrote a book called Man, Play and Games which builds directly on Huizinga’s social theory of play and provides a typology of play that helps account for different “functions” of play. These divisions lie along a spectrum of two qualitative descriptions of play types:

Paidia

    …an almost indivisible principle, common to diversion, turbulence, free improvisation, and carefree gaiety is dominant. It manifests a kind of uncontrolled fantasy that can be designated by the term paidia… It intervenes in every happy exuberance which effects an immediate and disordered agitation, an impulsive and easy recreation, but readily carried to excess, whose impromptu and unruly character remains its essential if not unique reason for being.

Ludus

    This latter principle is completely impractical, even though it requires an ever greater amount of effort, patience, skill, or ingenuity. I call this second component ludus… the primitive desire to find diversion and amusement in arbitrary, perpetually recurrent obstacles…the tension and skill of the player are not related to any explicit feeling of emulation or rivalry; the conflict is with the obstacle.

A good example of the former of these would be something like improvisational comedy. A good example of the latter of these would be a simple rule-based game like billiards or chess. Callois’s main point is that all games lie on a continuum between these two play types. I knew that the kind of gameplay that I loved in action games leaned toward paidia through activities such as exploration and navigation. The concept of paidia is still central to my thinking about what makes me enjoy my favorite games, and I am still trying to find ways to integrate it in prototypes that I work on.
