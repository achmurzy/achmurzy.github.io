My debt of influence to literature and drama in thinking about video games at this time is really a direct effect of the things I liked to do when I was younger. I read quite a lot when I was younger, and I’ll carry the effects of that until I die. It made transitioning to an emphasis on engineering and technology in order to learn how to develop games somewhat difficult, I believe. However, whatever clarity I have on the kinds of games I want to make comes from a deep love of narrative art and the identities of characters (people) I’ve known.

In 3D games that I love, the perspective is almost always 3rd-person. The camera is separate from the body the player inhabits, and simultaneously depicts the character and the world around it. In everybody’s favorite war games of death and destruction, the first-person style is used to enhance the sense of carrying, aiming and firing a gun. Other games have used this first-person style to a much greater effect, but I still prefer a third-person perspective. In one entry of my journal I took the time to consider the analogies between this kind of geometrical point-of-view in games and the literary point of view (related to narration), as well as the practical and stylistic effects of each on a narrative.

Modernist literature has inculcated the notion that the truest sense of a character is borne out in first-person narration, where a person’s thoughts and ideas can be freely expressed in the abstract–a form of expression largely unavailable to the theater, except perhaps by soliloquy and monologue. On the other hand, third-person narration casts a wider net, used to provide an “objective” sense of a wider variety of characters and details about circumstances. Even if the third-person narrator is omniscient, something is lost in the translation of a character’s thoughts and feelings into a narrator’s manner of speech.

Interestingly, the case is effectively reversed when considering point-of-view in video games. Here, a third-person point-of-view is necessary to actually see a character, to see it move and react to the world in a bodily sense. Here we can see facial expressions, the way the body contorts in motion, the posture of a character–all of these things are crucial to understanding the mood of a character in a 3D action game. The most important point for me is that certain kinds of 3D action gameplay are basically impossible unless the player has simultaneous knowledge of the character’s body in space, and the variety of objects around it (especially those outside of the character’s field-of-view). Again, think of how difficult a dynamic game like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater would be from a first-person perspective. There are notable exceptions to these points (Mirror’s Edge comes to mind first).

Conversely, first-person games attempt to replace the idea of a character with the player. The player comes closer to “owning” the body of a character. The player, at all times decides where to look. Approaching a writing desk, it sits at waist-level on the screen. All other parts of the environment are close, present, and open to visual exploration. This experience is unique to video games in many ways. It will surely be at the center of new kinds of interactive interfaces (VIRTUAL_XXX_REALITY_$$$), and reflects the fact that the most interesting character in each of our lives is usually ourselves.

In literature, a third-person perspective will usually cause a fundamental separation of authors and viewers from the content of the narrative. This is less true in video games, where ‘players’ are born from a positive feedback loop between viewership and authorship. Players interactively consume and produce narratives by participating in a game. My allegiance to a third-person perspective comes from a belief that this double-headed activity of consumptive production is most well-balanced by simultaneous view of the world (connected to viewership) and the character, the body (the agent of authorship).
