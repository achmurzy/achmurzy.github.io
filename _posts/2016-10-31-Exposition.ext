My sophomore year I started trying to make actual games. This was entirely facilitated by coursework at ASU–a fact that caused me some grief and anxiety. Inertia is difficult to overcome, and I did not feel autonomous at the time, creatively. I felt lazy and uncommitted to my ‘passion’. I started though. One of the purposes of this blog is to help me understand the extent to which my writing has responsible for that.

My first project was a largely feeble attempt. In some ways I underplanned (not knowing what practical concerns are necessary in undertaking a project) and in others I overplanned (writing pages and pages of exposition and prose on my ‘vision’ for the game–not actual design elements). The game was to be prepared in GameMaker8, a stripped-down, highly facilitated environment for visual programming of 2D games. The game would alternate perspectives between a brother and a sister exploring a city, looking for one another.

By now I was at least ~comfortable~ trying to program something, but was still learning the basics of graphics, physics, getting comfortable thinking about numbers… skills high school freshmen have on the East Coast. Undoubtedly my failure on this project stemmed from lacking a sense of urgency (not knowing how long good software development takes) and lacking technical skills (not knowing how to do software development/programming).

I don’t want to dive in to the details of how I envisioned the game. Rather, I’d like to try to explore some of the methods of planning I employed at the time. For example, in my journal I have under the heading “Tenants of gamplay”:

“-Actions can configure the environment

-The environment influences the range of actions available

-Certain actions against certain parts of the environment advances the player toward the win-state”

or “Questions:

-What modules are within the environment?

-What actions modify them, and how are they changed?

-What are the effects of this change on the bodies in play and the environment?

-How can we contextualize these modules and the actions which modify them in a city?”

Asking myself questions explicitly has been a hallmark of completing dialogues with myself and interrogating my own assumptions. Questions underlie my interest in the sciences as a road to knowledge, and at this time had begun to overflow into these endeavors. It is clear that the points above are cut directly from the cloth of my musings on games the year previous. These points do not help one understand what the game will ultimately be, or more importantly how to get there.

This pattern is continued for pages of exposition on my plans for the game. A large problem is continued use of abstractions such as “actions” or “modules” or “environment”. I used these as tools to complete generalized stylistic analyses and critical comparisons of video games and other artwork before. Here, I rely so heavily on them that when I sat down to make the game I had no conception of real elements, real data that needed to be included and manipulated to, you know, make something real.

This is a major red flag to me now. There is a self-perpetuating character to formulating and adhering too closely to a personal philosophy (or anyone else’s). This may also be why good criticism is so poignantly separate from good art. There are those who seek to explain and those who seek to create.

People who explain have to rely on the same tools over and over again across examples and situations. Any situation is squashed and molded to fit those precepts, and this is clearly what I did here. Taking coherent ideas on game-making in general, I attempted to create a plan that would adhere to it. This top-down approach must ultimately fail in creating art. I’m coming closer to understanding this. One must live in the world, and draw from it.

I’ve begun to suspect more and more that using language to organize my thoughts so heavily (and so concretely, through writing) has definite trade-offs associated with it. I’ve taken to explaining my struggles understanding mathematics this way (which is getting better). Granted, it feels completely involuntary and I must consider myself married to the habit. It may be a more fundamental feature of my body and mind, compared to those who think pictorially or otherwise. I can also choose to believe that there are ways to leverage it successfully, and to my advantage, by becoming very good at organizing ideas with writing.
