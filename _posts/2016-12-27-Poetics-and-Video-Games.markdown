I began reading Aristotle's Poetics one winter on a whim.
The work stands as one of the first pieces of literary theory in the Western cannon, and I
found myself stringing the thing up to meet my precepts of what a video game's narrative
should be. In the Poetics Aristotle marks down the famous distinction between tragedy and comedy.
I focused on his treatment of the elements of tragedy. Tragedy is

    an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude; in
language embellished with each kind of artistic ornament, the several kinds being found in
separate parts of the play; in the form of action, not narrative; through pity and fear
effecting the proper purgation of these emotions.

Aristotle has precise meanings behind ordinary-sounding words in this definition: action,
magnitude, serious, complete, pity, fear. I attempted to re-interpret these meanings in ways that would
result in a coherent understanding of tragedy (a dramatic narrative) in the context of video
games:

I. "In video games action is tantamount to gameplay."
II. "Action therefore is an expression of inputs and their results."
III. "For action to be complete, it must have a final end or optimal performance. An action is
    complete insofar as a the player defines its beginning or end."
IV. "To the extent that each input has a programmed output based on context, that action
    (input) has magnitude."
V. "Pity and fear emanate from the player's perspective when fulfilling a performance."

I was starting to think formally. I played like I could make "axioms", then toy with them to
prove my point. The last axiom forms the basis of most discussion--for Aristotle, pity and
fear are characteristics of both the characters in a play and the audience. The entire
purpose of tragedy is that the simulacrum of pity and fear on the stage, created by actors,
cures the audience of these emotions, which are ultimately damaging and painful. The main
connection I draw to video games is the way in which Aristotle's Poetics can be subverted when
these are considered as one entity embodied in the player.
   
    An action implies personal agents, who necessarily possess certain distinctive qualities
both of character and thought... and these are the two natural causes from which action springs.

Aristotle resorts to a concept called "movement-of-spirit" to describe the root causes of action
in tragedy, halting the regress of cause-and-effect represented by a plot. This accord well with
my intial definition of gameplay as a decision-making process. A "movement-of-spirit" is a
mystical Ancient-Greek way of saying decision.

Character for Aristotle is the intrinsic tendencies and convictions of a character. I interpreted
this as "...the set of acquired of inherited preferences for action in a specific gameplay system."
Thought is in many ways a more immediate version of character, describing the reactive tendencies
of a person--I interpreted this as "...action performed by the player in respose to specific feedback."
These remain completely abstract concepts. Aristotle does not even offer a typology for understanding
how these traits might vary person-to-person. They are assumed to be highly context-dependent, and
in my turn, I define each with respect to a specific game system--character and thought promise
to differ widely in Solitaire, Pong, and Tony Hawks Pro Skater. They can only be understood in
terms of the actions available to a person. That range of action was much more limited in
Aristotle's time.

    Plot is the imitation of the action: for by plot I here mean the arrangement of the
incidents.

In this way I am able to directly interpret the "plot" of a game as the sequences of gameplay
occurences and their effects. This is something I hold to myself to this day. Not only does the
plot of a video game vary from person to person, it varies from session to session. This
definition captures our intuition that decisions "matter" to some extent in games, and that
there is a uniqueness to the way that every person interacts with video games.

The rest of my entry with respect to the Poetics consists of bending over backwards to subvert
all of the terminology used to dissect tragedy. Around this time a friend told me that I should be
a game critic as we were discussing some of the theories I'd been exploring under the umbrella of
"game studies". This notion was viscerally unpleasant to me--I had always had a fear of becoming a
person such as that, sitting on the side-lines and dressing up other peoples' work in complicated
language. This exercise with Aristotle was part of a dying gasp from that side of myself. After this
point a painful transition was nearing completion, and I would turn my attention more completely to
science, engineering and mathematics.
