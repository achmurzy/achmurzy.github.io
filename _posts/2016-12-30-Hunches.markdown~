In the summer of my junior year I traveled to Pittsburgh to complete a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University in partnership with a close friend of mine
who was a theater student there at the time. This blog is supposed to be a sequential understanding of my frame of mind as understood through the transcription and interpretation of my journals,
so I don't want to jump too far ahead. However, one of the reasons I love reviewing the things I've written in the past (and why I'll never stop writing things down) is that sometimes it is easy to
see the seeds of flowers blooming in one's life today, on the pages left down in ink long before. One fateful entry "Expressing gameplay as language", written in the summer of my sophmore year,
became the impetus for an entire summer's research at Carnegie Mellon. While there, I considered the problem of automatically narrating interactive gameplay in a simple 3D environment.
    I had been informally studying linguistics, specifically formal approaches to the representation of languages (which would later become the basis of specifying programming languages), for
a while beforehand. I began to explore computational linguistics (what would become natural language processing--NLP) with an emphasis on formal grammars meant to deal with natural language in
real engineering settings (as opposed to scientific theories). These approaches would become my main line of attack when I was working at Carnegie. Needless to say we utterly failed, for reasons
familiar to NLP systems: it is easy to create something that works well in specific domains (in this case, a contextualized 3D environment and specific gameplay decisions) but generalizes poorly
to new domains (such as a completely different kind of video game).
    Around my sophmore year, this idea was more of a "hunch". Details in the journal are correspondingly sparse. The thrust of the idea is summarized in the following entry:
    Language is believably generated as sequences of formal symbols corresponding to various linguistic strucctures, down to individual words. Thus, a list of symbols must be generated by
gameplay, which corresponds to a sequence acceptable to whatever grammar you define. It seems to me then that the grammar must be written in terms of the rules of game-play acts.
I had some general notion that a mapping between discrete gameplay acts, ultimately reducible to inputs on specific buttons, could be mapped to the sequence of symbols inherent in every sentence
of language. I did not have any technical or mathematical understanding regarding how this could be done. I was still leery of this feeling--I was unsure of how the creative process was
driven, and uneducated about how to realize this vague "hunch" of mine. It is now clear to me that these "hunches" drive every creative process. It always starts with a feeling--that something
should "be" a certain way. This is as true for science as it is for the arts, philosophy. That I was able to drive this hunch forward is one of the proud points in my life. It is my current model
of how to support myself as a creative person in this world.
    Since this time I've been able to evolve my approach using more advanced techniques from Artificial Intelligence to handle the process of generating words to create believeable sentences.
More on that later.
